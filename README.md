I created this page from scratch. It is a portfolio page, which I will add to as the course progresses. It is intended to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position.  

In this challenge I've set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

I don't have web applications to showcase at this point, so I've usee placeholder images and names. I will change them to real applications as I create them later in the course.



The user story used to create this page, written from the perspective of a hiring manager is shown below.  

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
